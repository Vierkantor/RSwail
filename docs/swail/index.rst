Swail
"""""

Swail is a programming language designed to do what you want, expect and say,
in that order. The name is officially an acronym for "I forgot the words in
this acronym", but you can also expand it to:

* Super Wumbo Awesome Interesting Language
* Some Witty Acronym for an Interpreted Language
* Swail Wins Against Inferior Languages
* System Without Any Intelligence Left

or if you are currently wearing a suit, just call it:

* The Swail Language

Despite maybe standing for the initial letters of words, you should write and
pronounce Swail like it's a word (or more precisely, a proper noun), i.e.
"Swail" and /sweɪl/, not "SWAIL" and /ɛs ˈdʌbl̩.juː eɪ aɪ ɛl/.

Swail is supposed to be straightforward to write and read. It draws inspiration
from Python and Haskell, which you might appreciate if you enjoy that kind of
languages.  A lot of the language features are explained by analogy to either
of those languages. However, it does have its own conventions, so you can't
always translate concepts one-to-one between languages.

RSwail is a very very old implementation of the perpetually-being-redeveloped-language Swail.
Here, you can find documentation for an old edition of the language Swail and for the Swail
implementation called RSwail.

5 years later, Swail is now a part of the operating system XukutOS, with more up to date documentation available at gemini://vierkantor.com/xukut/manual/swail.gmi
